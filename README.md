## Used technologies

- MERN Stack: The Job Application Tracker is built on the powerful MERN stack, which includes:

  - MongoDB: As the database of choice, MongoDB stores and manages application data efficiently.

  - Express.js: Express.js serves as the backend framework, providing robust API endpoints and handling server-side logic.

  - React: The frontend of the application is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

  - Node.js: Node.js powers the server, allowing for scalable and efficient handling of requests and authentication.

- Vite for React: Vite is used as a build tool for the React frontend. 

- JWT Token Authentication: To ensure user privacy and security, the Job Application Tracker utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. JWT tokens are generated and verified to grant secure access to user accounts and features.

- Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is employed as the primary CSS library for styling the website. Its utility-first approach simplifies the creation of responsive designs.

   - Medium Priority: Highlighted in blue.

   - Low Priority: Highlighted in green.

3. Comments and Notes: Add comments and notes to each application to record important insights, follow-ups, or any additional information you find relevant.

For virtual interviews, store Zoom meeting links within the application details, eliminating the hassle of searching for meeting information when needed.

7. Archive Functionality: Unwanted applications can be moved to the archive, serving as a digital recycle bin. From the archive, you have the flexibility to:

  - Restore Applications: Easily recover applications from the archive to your active folders.

  - Permanent Deletion: Permanently delete applications from the archive when they are no longer needed.

## Adobe XD for Basic Wireframe Design:

Adobe XD played a crucial role in the initial design phase of the Job Application Tracker. It was used to create basic wireframes and mockups, providing a visual representation of the application's user interface and user experience. Adobe XD facilitated the visualization and planning of key design elements, ensuring a user-friendly and intuitive interface for the final product.
